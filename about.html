            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am a dedicated and enthusiastic third-year Computer Science student with a strong foundation in software development, data structures, algorithms, and web technologies. I have a passion for learning new programming languages and frameworks and enjoy solving complex problems through innovative solutions. Throughout my academic journey, I have worked on several projects that have honed my skills in both front-end and back-end development, and I am eager to apply my knowledge to real-world applications. I am currently seeking opportunities to expand my experience in the field, particularly in software engineering and artificial intelligence.
